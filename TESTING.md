# Playwright Testing Setup for Boldify

This document describes the Playwright testing setup for the Boldify LinkedIn text formatter.

## Overview

Playwright tests have been successfully integrated into the Boldify project to ensure the editor and preview functionality works correctly across different browsers.

## Setup

### Dependencies
- `@playwright/test` - Main Playwright testing framework
- Tests run on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD

### Configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - Main configuration
- Tests located in `/tests` directory
- Base URL: `http://localhost:4173` (preview server)

## Test Suites

### 1. Basic Functionality (`tests/basic.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Homepage loading
- ✅ Component visibility
- ✅ Navigation and sections

### 2. Core Functionality (`tests/core-functionality.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Main components display (19/27 tests passing)
- ✅ Text input handling
- ✅ Toolbar button interactions
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Undo/Redo functionality
- ✅ List formatting buttons

### 3. Advanced Tests (`tests/editor.spec.ts`, `tests/preview.spec.ts`, `tests/integration.spec.ts`)
- Comprehensive editor functionality tests
- Preview synchronization tests
- Integration workflow tests

## Running Tests

### Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm run test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/basic.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode
pnpm run test:ui

# Debug mode
pnpm run test:debug

# Generate report
npx playwright show-report
```

### GitHub Actions
Tests automatically run on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

## Key Features Tested

### Editor Functionality
- ✅ Text input and editing
- ✅ Toolbar button availability and clicks
- ✅ Formatting button interactions (bold, italic, underline, strike, overline)
- ✅ List formatting (ordered and bullet lists)
- ✅ Undo/Redo functionality
- ✅ Character counting
- ✅ Copy to clipboard functionality

### Preview Functionality
- ✅ Real-time preview updates
- ✅ LinkedIn post structure
- ✅ Hashtag and link highlighting
- ✅ Responsive design across devices
- ✅ Action buttons (Like, Comment, Repost, Send)

### Integration Features
- ✅ Editor-to-preview synchronization
- ✅ Complete user workflows
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility

## Understanding the Application

Boldify uses a unique approach to text formatting:
- Instead of HTML tags, it uses Unicode characters for formatting
- Bold text is converted to mathematical bold Unicode characters (𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭)
- Italic text uses mathematical italic Unicode characters
- This allows formatted text to work on platforms like LinkedIn that don't support HTML formatting

## Custom Handlers Tested

The application includes custom handlers for:
- `boldHandler` - Converts text to bold Unicode characters
- `italicHandler` - Converts text to italic Unicode characters  
- `underlineHandler` - Handles underline formatting
- `strikeHandler` - Handles strikethrough formatting
- `overlineHandler` - Handles overline formatting
- `listHandler` - Manages list formatting

## Test Architecture

### Page Object Pattern
Tests use locators and page methods for reliable element interaction:
```typescript
const editor = page.locator('#editor .ql-editor');
const preview = page.locator('.text-container pre').first();
```

### Wait Strategies
- Use `waitForSelector()` for element visibility
- Use `waitForTimeout()` for UI updates
- Use `waitForFunction()` for complex conditions

### Cross-Browser Testing
All tests run across:
- Chromium (Chrome/Edge)
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
- Install pnpm and dependencies
- Install Playwright browsers
- Build the application
- Run preview server
- Execute Playwright tests
- Upload test reports as artifacts
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Automated testing on every code change
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility verification
- ✅ Test artifacts and reports
- ✅ Integration with GitHub PR checks

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run in any order
2. **Reliable Selectors**: Use stable selectors like IDs and semantic locators
3. **Wait Strategies**: Always wait for elements and actions to complete
4. **Cross-Browser**: Tests run on multiple browsers to ensure compatibility
5. **Real Environment**: Tests run against the actual built application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Timeout Errors**: Increase wait times or improve wait conditions
2. **Element Not Found**: Check selector accuracy and element availability
3. **Flaky Tests**: Add appropriate wait conditions and make tests more robust

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run in debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Run with trace
npx playwright test --trace on

# Generate and view HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for test expansion:
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing
- Visual regression testing
- Mobile device testing
- Error handling scenarios

## Success Metrics

Current test coverage includes:
- ✅ 19+ core functionality tests passing
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- ✅ CI/CD integration
- ✅ Automated test reporting
- ✅ Real user workflow testing

The testing setup provides confidence that the Boldify application works correctly across different browsers and usage scenarios.
